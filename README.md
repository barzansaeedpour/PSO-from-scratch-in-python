# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm  from scratch in Python

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm from scratch in Python. PSO is a popular optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. This implementation is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a great resource for learning about the PSO algorithm.

## Features

- Python implementation of the PSO algorithm.
- Configurable parameters for swarm size, maximum iterations, optimization function, etc.
- A straightforward code structure for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/barzansaeedpour/PSO-from-scratch-in-python.git
    ```

2. run the main file:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
